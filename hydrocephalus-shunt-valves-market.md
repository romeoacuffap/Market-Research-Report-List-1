<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocephalus Shunt Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Pressure</li><li>Monopressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrocephalus shunt valves market comprises primarily two types: adjustable pressure and monopressure valves. Adjustable pressure valves allow clinicians to modify the pressure setting post-implantation, accommodating changes in a patient's condition. This flexibility is beneficial for long-term management. In contrast, monopressure valves have a fixed pressure setting, offering simplicity and ease of use. While monopressure valves are reliable, adjustable pressure valves provide enhanced adaptability, making them suitable for cases requiring ongoing adjustments to cerebrospinal fluid pressure management.</p></p>
