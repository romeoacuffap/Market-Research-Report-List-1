<p><strong>The Direct Air Capture (DAC or DACCS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Absorption in Liquid Media</li><li>Adsorption on Solid Media</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a technology designed to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere to combat climate change. Two primary market types for DAC include physical absorption in liquid media and adsorption on solid media. In physical absorption, CO2 is dissolved in a liquid solvent, allowing for separation from the air. Conversely, adsorption on solid media involves trapping CO2 onto solid materials, which can then be processed or stored. Both methods aim to efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations.</p></p>
